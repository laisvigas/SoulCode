            <h2 class="first-article-title">Attack on Titan</h2>
            <p>
                Attack on Titan (Shingeki no Kyojin), created by Hajime Isayama, is a Japanese manga series that reshaped the dark fantasy and post-apocalyptic genres. Launched in 2009 in Bessatsu Shōnen Magazine and concluded in 2021 with 34 volumes, the series became known for its gripping story, intense themes, and unpredictable narrative twists. Set in a world where humanity is cornered by giant humanoid creatures called Titans, the story follows Eren Yeager, a young man determined to avenge his family and uncover the truth behind the Titans. Together with friends Mikasa Ackerman and Armin Arlert, he joins the Survey Corps, embarking on a journey that exposes deep secrets and existential dangers threatening all of humanity.

                What sets Attack on Titan apart is its exploration of complex themes, including freedom, survival, and the nature of human conflict. The plot evolves from simple survival to political intrigue and moral ambiguity, reflecting on cycles of violence and the heavy cost of pursuing justice. The initial art style, rough yet evocative, develops over time to mirror the intense narrative shifts, culminating in a visually and emotionally powerful ending. With over 100 million copies sold worldwide and a highly popular anime adaptation, Attack on Titan leaves a lasting legacy in manga, inspiring fans with its blend of action, psychological depth, and philosophical inquiry.

            <h2>Fullmetal Alchemist</h2>
            <p>
                Fullmetal Alchemist by Hiromu Arakawa is a landmark Japanese manga series that blends action, adventure, and deep philosophical themes. Serialized from 2001 to 2010 in Monthly Shōnen Gangan and later compiled into 27 volumes, the story follows brothers Edward and Alphonse Elric, alchemists who commit a taboo by attempting to resurrect their deceased mother. The failed transmutation costs Edward his arm and leg, while Alphonse loses his entire body, his soul bound to a suit of armor. Driven by guilt and a desire to restore their bodies, the brothers embark on a journey to find the Philosopher’s Stone, encountering friends, foes, and moral dilemmas that challenge their beliefs about humanity, sacrifice, and power.

                Fullmetal Alchemist’s success lies in its nuanced storytelling and exploration of themes like the price of ambition, the ethical implications of scientific progress, and the concept of equivalent exchange. Set in a world resembling early 20th-century Europe, the story addresses societal and political issues, from war to discrimination. Arakawa’s art evolves to emphasize both intense action sequences and emotional subtleties, delivering a story that resonates on multiple levels. Both the manga and its anime adaptations, especially Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, have garnered critical acclaim, cementing the series as a classic that continues to inspire audiences around the world.
