# Calculator Project

## Objective
Create a functional calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator must perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and display the result to the user.

## Interface
The calculator should have a simple interface with the following elements:
- A display area to show the current number and results.
- Numeric buttons from 0 to 9.
- Buttons for basic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (ร), and division (รท).
- An equals (=) button to calculate the result.
- A clear (C) button to clear the display.

## Functionality
- When clicking on numeric buttons, the number should appear on the display.
- When clicking on an operation, the current number should be stored, and the selected operation should wait for the next input.
- When clicking on "=", the calculator should perform the operation with the entered numbers and display the result.
- When clicking on "C", the display should be cleared to start a new operation.

## Styling (CSS)
- Style the interface so that the buttons are organized and visually appealing.
- The display should be highlighted and resemble the appearance of a physical calculator.

## Extras (Optional)
- Add extra functionalities such as percentage (%), decimal point (.).
