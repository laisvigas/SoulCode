# HTML Project Description

The project consists of creating a static web page for a specific product. This page should present relevant information about the product, such as name, description, image, features, and a contact form. Development will be done exclusively in HTML. The focus is to explore the structure and HTML elements, ensuring proper organization and semantics.

## Objectives
- Practice building a complete and semantic HTML structure.
- Correctly use elements such as headers, paragraphs, images, links, lists, tables, and forms.

## Requirements
- **Main Header and Sections**: Use a header with a title for the page or product name. Create sections with subtitles to organize the product information, such as description, features, and contact form.
- **Product Description Paragraph**: Include a paragraph that describes the product in detail, highlighting the main features or benefits.
- **Product Image**: Display a relevant image of the product. The image must have an alt attribute with a clear and specific description of the image.
- **Link to Other Products or Contact**: Add a link to other product pages.
- **Product Features List**: Create an unordered list with the main features of the product. If there are sequential details or steps, use an ordered list.
- **Technical Specifications Table**: Include a table with the technical specifications of the product, such as dimensions, weight, and other technical data.
- **Contact Form**: Create a simple form for users to send questions about the product. Include fields such as: Name, Email, Message, Terms Acceptance, and Submit Button.
- Add a footer to the page with information about page rights and a link to access the FAQ page.
- Add an FAQ page for frequently asked questions. On this page, include a title and a list of questions with their respective answers (the page should be navigable).
